// T1 (DF2): each pattern now carries TWO capture groups — group 1 is the

// the content that follows it. Previously only the after-keyword content was
// captured, so a negation like "never" / "must not" was discarded and a
// prohibition inverted into an instruction ("Never use X" stored as "use X").
// `extractFromPatterns` reassembles group1 + a clause-bounded group2 (T2, via
// `boundToClause` below) rather than reading a single fixed-width group —
// group 2's own reach is widened to {1,500} because the true stopping point
// is now found by content, not counted characters. Keeping the keyword in
// its own group (rather than folding it into one bigger capture) matters:
// `boundToClause` must scan for a clause boundary only in group 2, never in
// group 1 — several keywords end in their own colon ("error:", "rule:",
// "decision:") which is not a clause boundary in the prose sense and would
// wrongly truncate the capture down to just the keyword if scanned.
// `PREFERENCE_PATTERNS[0]` is the one exception — its two-capture-group
// shape means something different (two content spans either side of
// "instead of"/"over"/"not") and is a separate, backlogged defect (see
// docs/plans/2026-08-23-df2-capture-anchoring.md); left as-is.
