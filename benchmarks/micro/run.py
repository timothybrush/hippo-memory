"""Micro-eval harness for hippo.

Tier 1 in the eval pyramid:
  Tier 1 (this) - 20-50 fixture QAs, deterministic substring scoring, ~30s.
                  Run on every code change. Targets one mechanic per fixture.
  Tier 2        - LoCoMo stratified subsample (run.py with --conversations 1
                  --sample 10 --score-mode evidence). ~5-10 min, run before PR.
  Tier 3        - LoCoMo full (1982 QAs). ~85 min evidence / ~6h judge.
                  Release gate only.

Each fixture is a JSON file under fixtures/ with shape:

  {
    "name": "decay-basic",
    "mechanic": "decay",                  # decay | recall | consolidation | salience | ...
    "remembers": [                         # ordered hippo remember calls
      "Bob's coffee order is oat milk latte",
      "Alice prefers green tea",
      {"text": "...", "tags": ["auth-rewrite"]},  # object form attaches --tag flags
      {"text": "...", "cwd_subdir": "proj-x/lib"}  # optional, see cwd_subdir below
    ],
    "actions": [                           # optional, run after remembers in order
      {"type": "supersede",
       "remember_index": 0,
       "new_content": "Bob switched to oat milk flat white"}
    ],
    "queries": [
      {"q": "what does Bob drink",
       "must_contain_any": ["oat milk", "latte"],     # at least one in top-k
       "must_not_contain_any": ["espresso"],          # optional, all must be ABSENT
       "top_k": 3,
       "cli_args": ["--include-superseded"],
       "cwd_subdir": "proj-x/lib"}                    # optional, see cwd_subdir below
    ]
  }

cwd_subdir (optional, object-form `remembers` items, `queries` items, and
`recall`-type `actions` items): a relative path such as "proj-x/lib". When
present, the item's hippo subprocess is run with that directory (resolved as
`hippo_home / cwd_subdir`, created via `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`)
as its cwd instead of `hippo_home` itself -- this lets a fixture exercise
hippo's cwd-derived path tags (see src/path-context.ts) by writing/querying
memories from different simulated project directories within one fixture's
temp HIPPO_HOME. Rejected (raises ValueError naming the fixture): absolute
paths, paths with a drive letter, and any path containing a '..' segment.
Plain-string `remembers` items and `queries`/`actions` items without the key
keep today's behavior (cwd = hippo_home) unchanged.

Action types:
  - supersede: marks remembers[remember_index] as superseded_by a new memory
               whose content is `new_content`. Sets `entry.superseded_by`
               on the original. Equivalent to `hippo supersede <id> "..."`.
  - outcomes:  applies positive/negative outcomes to remembers[remember_index].
               Calls `hippo outcome --good --id <id>` `good` times and
               `hippo outcome --bad --id <id>` `bad` times. Used by both
               vmPFC value attribution and OFC option-value scenarios.
               Example:
                 {"type": "outcomes", "remember_index": 0, "good": 3, "bad": 0}
  - recall:    runs `hippo recall <query> --limit 1` `times` times. The
               `--limit 1` caps the result set BEFORE markRetrieved() in
               cli.ts, so only the top-ranked match has retrieval_count bumped
               (recall without a limit bumps every returned memory). The
               `query` must rank the target memory at #1 — a unique marker
               token is the canonical pattern. The harness verifies via
               `hippo trace <id>` that retrieval_count >= times. Used by
               pineal-salience scenarios where "salience" emerges from USE
               rather than lexical overlap. Accepts an optional `cwd_subdir`
               (see cwd_subdir above) to run the recall calls from a
               simulated project directory. Example:
                 {"type": "recall", "query": "marker-pineal-1",
                  "remember_index": 0, "times": 3}
  - promote:   runs `hippo promote <id>` (copies remembers[remember_index]
               from its LOCAL store into the per-fixture global store) from
               the SAME cwd the remember was written from (the harness
               tracks each remember's resolved cwd in `remember_cwds`,
               parallel to `remember_ids`). Raises RuntimeError naming the
               fixture if the id was not captured (mirrors the supersede
               precedent above — never passes None to the CLI).
  - forget:    runs `hippo forget <id>` for remembers[remember_index] from
               its tracked cwd. Hard-deletes the memory from that cwd's
               LOCAL store only — a prior `promote` of the same remember
               (if any) is unaffected, since it lives in the global store.
               Same uncaptured-id RuntimeError as `promote`.
  - reject:    runs `hippo reject <id> --reason <reason>` for
               remembers[remember_index] from its tracked cwd (AT1 tombstone:
               the row is removed and its content digest is refused on later
               writes). `reason` is required. With `"reattempt": true` the
               runner then re-runs `hippo remember <original text>` from the
               same cwd and REQUIRES a non-zero exit whose stderr mentions the
               rejected value; a successful re-remember is a RuntimeError,
               because the fixture's later must-not assertion would otherwise
               be testing a row that was simply never re-stored.
               Same store scope as `forget`: the row and the tombstone live
               in that cwd's LOCAL store, so a prior `promote` of the same
               remember (a copy in the global store) is unaffected.
               Example: {"type": "reject", "remember_index": 3,
                         "reason": "wrong retry policy", "reattempt": true}

  Ordering constraint (actions run in declared order): a `forget` or
  `reject` of a remember hard-deletes its local id, so any `promote` of
  that same remember MUST be declared BEFORE it in the fixture's `actions`
  list — a `promote` declared after would try to promote an id the local
  store no longer has.

  Cross-store fixture authoring note: when a fixture's queries compare
  memories that live in different stores (e.g. promoted globals vs.
  untouched locals), keep each competitor's content under 200 chars and
  make them diverge in their first 200 chars — cross-store dedup keys on
  `content.slice(0, 200)` (src/shared.ts:287), so two competitors sharing
  a >=200-char-identical prefix would collapse into one row.

Usage:
  python benchmarks/micro/run.py
  python benchmarks/micro/run.py --filter decay
  python benchmarks/micro/run.py --baseline results/baseline.json   # diff vs baseline

Pass criterion: every query's top-k results must contain at least one
substring from must_contain_any (case-insensitive). If must_not_contain_any
is set, NONE of those substrings may appear in the top-k.
